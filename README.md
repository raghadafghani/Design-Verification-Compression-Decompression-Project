# Design-Verification-Compression-Decompression-Project
This project verifies a hardware compression and decompression chip using a dictionary-based algorithm. The chip compresses data by comparing inputs to stored data and outputting an index, and decompresses by retrieving data. It includes I/O ports for commands and status. Phases: reference model, verification plan, UVM environment.
